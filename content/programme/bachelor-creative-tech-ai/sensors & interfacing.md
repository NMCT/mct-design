**Subject to change**

Sensors and Interacing is the first course which will teach you about the basics of interfacing with hardware. You will learn about the basics of sensors and how to program them. You will also learn about the basics of interfacing with hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ESP32 microcontrollers.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
