**Subject to change**

To prepare for your bachelors thesis, you will create an innovative project guided by one of the specialised coaches.
For this project, you will work alone, with extensive coaching by experts.
The goal is to create a Proof of Concept of a research question either chosen yourself, given from a coach or from a company.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
