In the course of Datamanagement, you learn all about SQL databases and how to set them up correctly according to the best practices currently in the field.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
