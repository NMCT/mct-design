We begin with the basics — equations, powers, and computation rules — and move on to functions and how they behave.
You'll learn how to interpret and apply derivatives, explore vectors and their operations, and dive into linear algebra with matrices, transformations, and eigenvalues.
With AI examples and exercises, you'll gain the tools to understand and develop AI systems from the basics.
