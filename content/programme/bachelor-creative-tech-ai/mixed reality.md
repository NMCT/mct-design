**Subject to change**

Mixed Reality continues on the expertise of Unity that was taught to you in Semester 4, by the experts of DAE.
In Mixed Reality, you will learn how to create a Mixed Reality experience, using the Microsoft HoloLens and other Mixed Reality devices.
Incorporating AI and dashboards into the virtual 3D world visualised using the Hololens will be a key part of this course.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the XR Developer track.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
