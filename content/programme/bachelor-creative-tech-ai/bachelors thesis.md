**Subject to change**

To finalise your Bachelors degree, you will need to write a Bachelors thesis. This is similar to the Dutch-version in the MCT curriculum and is equal for each student.
You will write about the technical project you created in the Innovation & Research Project course.
By talking with experts in the field, you will form an advice on the project you created for future students.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
