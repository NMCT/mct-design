The course of Advanced Data Engineering continues where Big Data has stopped.
Learning to program on the big datasets, processing them in a matter of minutes or seconds, or even web scraping data, is all part of this course.

A second part contains visualisation techniques and libraries in Python which will help in explaining and showing your data in readable and understandable structures.
