Creating an API for AI models requires some knowledge of Backend Development.
By connecting multiple systems together using API's we can easily query AI models and complex databases and give information back to different interfaces.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer, XR Developer and Next Web Developer tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
