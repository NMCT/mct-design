Curious how AI writes text or imagines images on its own? In this course, you will explore the world of generative AI.
We will look at how models like transformers and diffusion models work, how to craft effective prompts, and how to combine your own knowledge with models using RAG and GraphRAG.
We will also dive into HuggingFace and explore agents that can perform tasks autonomously.
