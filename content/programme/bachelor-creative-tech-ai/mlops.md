You know how to create AI models using either Neural Networks or Machine Learning algorithms, but keeping them running is a different story. In MLOps, you will learn how to create a pipeline for your AI models, so that they can be deployed and used in a production environment. You will learn how to use Azure to create a cloud solution for your AI project.
Keeping the AI model managable and up to date is a specialised expertise you will master in this course.
The focus is on reusable and reproducible AI models, as well as responsible and fair AI.
Knowledge of LLMs and RAGs allow us to focus on the latest trends, and how they can be deployed in a production environment.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer tracks.
