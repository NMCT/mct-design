You know how to create AI models using either Neural Networks or Machine Learning algorithms, but keeping them running is a different story. In MLOps, you will learn how to create a pipeline for your AI models, so that they can be deployed and used in a production environment. You will learn how to use Azure to create a cloud solution for your AI project.
Keeping the AI model managable and up to date is a specialised expertise you will master in this course.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer tracks.
