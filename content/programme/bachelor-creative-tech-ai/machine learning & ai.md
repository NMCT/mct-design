**Subject to change**

Machine Learning & AI focusses on the basics of Artificial Intelligence. By processing datasets and using algorithms, you will learn how to create a machine learning model. You will learn how to use this model to predict future outcomes, based on the data you have collected. 

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists the AI Engineer track.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
