In Deep Learing, your AI skills will be honed. You go further on the knowledge of Machine Learning, but this time, you let the Neural Networks do the job.
Feed it some data, choose the right model and let AI do the rest.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer track.
