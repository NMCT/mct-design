As a modern IT professional, you know that managing complex applications can be challenging. Virtualization, Python virtual environments (venv), microservices, and DevOps all have their own challenges. Fortunately, there are containerization and orchestration to simplify and scale the management of your applications.

In this module, we will teach you everything you need to know about containerization & orchestration. We start with a solid foundation and explain why Docker is so popular. You will learn how to design and optimize containers using Dockerfiles. Additionally, we will explore how to make containers work together as services using Docker Compose. And last but not least, we will teach you how to deploy this at a large scale with Kubernetes.

As usual, we take a hands-on approach, so you will receive many challenging hands-on labs! In addition to the practical aspect, we will also provide theoretical background so that you understand what's happening behind the scenes. By taking this module, you will learn the key building blocks suitable for any modern IT application.
