Big Data & AI is all about exploring the different big data storage systems and how to set them up and use them. From ElasticSearch as a famous NoSQL Search Engine storage, over to InfluxDB, one of the best TimeSeries database systems currently in use. By learning how to properly and quickly transform data for the different database systems, you prepare the best environment for AI.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer track.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
