The English taught Bachelor in Creative Technologies & AI has a one-year, short-track option to transform you at an accelerated pace into an AI engineer. The short track option has been put to the test over the past four years by no fewer than 300 professionals who received the same content over a two-year period in a blended learning program (also called AI @home). The short track,  consisting of 60 ECTS, excels because of its hands-on "learn from the professionals" approach, allowing you turn your ideas into fully functional, professionally deployed AI products.

This is the ideal addition to your current computer science/technical/scientific degree as it focuses on learning-by-doing alongside our local students and professionals. Starting with your already excellent knowledge of coding, mathematics and statistics, our aim is to turn you into a professional AI engineer. We welcome Belgian professionals and graduates alongside our international students. The result is an excellent community mix of academic and professional experience and know-how. In order to provide the flexibility our students need; we offer the course material both online and on campus.

## Overview
Fascinated by artificial intelligence, you are determined to join the ranks of the best AI professionals out there. Perhaps you already have coding skills or a strong foundation in statistics, or both. Maybe you already hold an academic or professional bachelor’s that included classes in artificial intelligence. But the step from academic study to the professional world can be quite challenging. How do you build fully operational AI solutions? How do you make sure those solutions are flexible enough to benefit from new insights, code, or data? 

That is what the one-year short-track of the English taught Bachelor in Creative Technology & AI is all about.
