Partner schools in Taiwan, Kazachstan, Mexico, Uganda, South Africa, California, Sweden, Spain and The Netherlands are just a few of them. The English Taught Courses of **AI Engineer** have had a wide interest over the years. Starting from the academic year 2023-2024, students can enroll in the first full English-Taught Bachelor in the form of **Creative Technologies and AI**.

This bachelor is specifically built around AI and XR (Extended Reality) and is a future-proof choice. Belgian students as well as a multitude of nationalities will follow these AI-centered courses.
