introtext:
- Howest MCT has a long history in receiving students from international universities and colleges from all around the world. Partner schools in Taiwan, Kazachstan, Mexico, Uganda, South Africa, California, Sweden, Spain and The Netherlands are just a few of them. The English Taught Courses of **AI Engineer** and **IoT Infrastructure Engineer** have had a wide interest over the years. Starting from the academic year 2022 to 2023, students can enroll in the first full English Taught Year of AI Engineer. This course targets international students as well as students from other universities in Flanders for a Short-Term English-Taught course.
- The teachers are not only used to receiving multiple international students each year, they also guide students to take their courses in parntering universities. One year? Half a year? Only an internship? There are countless possibilities regarding an international experience, and you're never alone. The Howest Buddy system is a good opportunity for foreigners to learn about the Flemish life-style and the student time in Kortrijk.
