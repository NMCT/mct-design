**Start-up** is a module that requires international and / or **interdisciplinary teamwork**: you get the chance to work together with Energy Management or Industrial Product Design students.
You start in a motivated team of young entrepreneurs with **a great idea for a product** or **a service** and at the end you deliver a prototype or business case and a **business plan**.

You are not alone in this endeavour: preppers, experts, teacher-coaches and dreamcoaches help you all the way. If you want to, you can start your own business in the second semester. Not all students have to become entrepreneurs but all future employers value intrapreneurial employees. A great way to show off your skills is the **annual young entrepreneurs fair**.
