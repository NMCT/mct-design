This course, taught with the main programming language being C# (C Sharp), tackles most of the advanced software principles such as Threading, Garbage Collection and Asynchronous programming.

We will be creating .NET console apps to demonstrate all you need to know about C# and teach you the advanced princples.

You will be able to transform the knowledge you gained in Basic Programming (object oriented programming in Python) to C#.NET, added by extra concepts of object oriented programming.

You will be able to read and/or manipulate data asynchronously, using existing data sources in the cloud that can be delivered in various formats (such as csv, JSON, etc.).

Furthermore, you will learn how to code faster and/or more efficient using specific principles in both C#.NET and NET. We will also see some advanced concepts like threading or design patterns
