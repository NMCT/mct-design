Reinforcement Learning is the process of learning from experience. It is a form of machine learning that is used to train AI models to make decisions in a given environment. The AI model is trained by interacting with its environment and learning from the consequences of its actions. By using 3D-simulations, you will learn how to create an AI model that can learn from its environment and make decisions based on the data it has collected.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in the AI Engineer track.
