Data Science prepares you for the AI-world by properly introducing you to statistics and data magic and analytics. This way, no dataset ever contains any secrets for you anymore.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
