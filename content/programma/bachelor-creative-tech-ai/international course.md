**Subject to change**

This international course of 3 studycredits offer some different options.
As an incoming international student, you have the possibility to follow either Basic Dutch or Basic English. Both of these courses can help in increasing your language knowledge.

English will help to better understand the courses that will be taught by your teachers. This will also help you communicate with other students.

By learning Basic Dutch, you'll have a little knowledge of one of the languages spoken in Belgium. Dutch is the native language in Kortrijk.

An alternative to these language courses is to follow the course "Meeting Flanders Today" which is given by the colleagues of the Tourism bachelor.
This course contains some interesting field trips to different places in Belgium.

Flemish students can optionally take the Basic English course to also increase their skills.
