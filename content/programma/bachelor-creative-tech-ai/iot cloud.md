In IoT Cloud, the first steps towards Azure cloud are taken. You explore the different possibilities and what cloud services have to offer. You will learn how to use Azure to create a cloud solution for your IoT project.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
