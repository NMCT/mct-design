**Subject to change**

Working together in team is all fun and games, also when working for projects for external clients.
In Industry Project, you will be assigned a project by an external client. You will work together with your team to deliver a project that meets the requirements of the client. This project lies in the field of AI, but will contain some side steps to Web, XR and Infrastructure as well.
You will also work together with the Dutch students following the regular MCT bachelor.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
