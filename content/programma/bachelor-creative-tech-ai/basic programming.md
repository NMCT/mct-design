Taking the first steps in the world of programming using the Basic Programming course. We chose for Python to prepare you for the AI-world ahead in the coming semesters.
Everthing from variables to inheritance in objects and classes, over to loops and recursive programming is all tackled in this course.

Note: This course is also taught in the regular MCT bachelor, where it exists in all tracks.
For the Bachelor of Creative Technologies & AI, this has been slightly adapted to suit their needs.
