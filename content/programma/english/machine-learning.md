### End goal
IoT and machine learning are the driving forces of the fourth industrial revolution that is rapidly transforming the world as we know it today. This will inevitably lead to a (nature) shift in the labor market. Many (repetitive jobs) will be taken over by AI applications. 

However, there will be enormous opportunities for IT professionals with knowledge of machine learning who can integrate smart algorithms and system.

Particular emphasis is placed on the conceptual understanding of how certain algorithms work. It is important to be able to choose the right machine learning algorithms, train them, evaluate them correctly and improve their performance through hyperparameter tuning.

### Themes
- Supervised learning where you learn from labeled data: Linear (multiple) regression with which you can predict continuous outputs. Examples are predicting stock prices, estimating the age of a person based on a picture of the face, predicting risks, making predictions of sales numbers, etc. Classification allows you to divide data into categories. Face recognition, handwriting recognition, cancer detection, predicting whether someone will click on an advertisement or link are just a few examples. Topics and algorithms that are discussed are logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Trees and Ensemble learning.
 
- Unsupervised learning where you get information from non-labeled data. Clustering techniques where you look for similar data. In this way you can discover patterns, relationships and similarities in complex multi-dimensional data. Dimensionality reduction allows us to transform data to the essence. For example, data can be presented more compactly or the performance of machine learning prediction techniques can be increased.
 
- Neural networks, inspired by how the brain works, allow us to extract insights from data that until recently were not possible. In the machine learning module we look at its conceptual functioning and we build neural networks for regression and classification. This lays the foundation for the deep learning module that builds on this.
