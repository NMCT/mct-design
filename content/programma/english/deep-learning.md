**Choice between Deep Learning or AI for Healthcare**

### End goal
The deep learning module continues where the machine learning module has stopped, namely in the neural networks. Applications include natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

### Themes
- Repetition of neural networks and introduction to deep learing.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that are mainly used for image recognition.
- Auto encoders and restricted Bolzmann machines: can reconstruct lost or damaged data but can also be used to generate music or make suggestions.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Used for, for example, image generation, predicting which medicine will work with certain symptoms, etc.
- Recommendation systems for generating personalized recommendations.
- Neural networks with memory: Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-term memory networks (LSTM): applications include natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- Reinforcement learning: the algorithm learns through interaction with the environment.
