The internship is the ideal way to test the practical knowledge and experiences. Because a solid company internship requires a certain period of integration, 15 weeks are provided for this. The objective of the internship is twofold: you will gain insight in the business and work on one or more AI business project or research assignments.

To ensure the smooth running of the internship, an internship agreement is completed and signed by the three parties involved prior to the internship (the internship company, the student and the study programme). The internship agreement clearly states the expected tasks and results of the intern (=the project sheet). In general, we impose three conditions on the internship company: professional supervision, your own workplace and a well-defined assignment of a sufficiently high level.

During the internship period, the student is assigned two supervisors: the internship mentor who is responsible for the daily supervision within the company and the internship supervisor who supervises the student from a distance (based on the internship report).
