This module helps you with a crash course in multiple topics needed for the rest of the curriculum. It is therefore a must to follow this course, and help you get on the track we require.

You will learn about the basics of Data Science and statistics to prepare you for the [Machine Learning](/programma/english/machine-learning) course.
For [MLOps](/programma/english/mlops) you will need some knowledge of the Linux operating system, and know the basics of containerization and how to work with it (mostly with Docker).
It is also interesting to know the basics of Object Oriented Programming, for most of the courses in the curriculum,

These hands-on sessions will help you master the skills before the classes start.
It is advised you **start watching some video's** upon arrival to better prepare for the first weeks of class.
