This course will deepen your knowledge and show the most interesting side of the Flanders region (and Belgium in general). Along with international tourism students, we’ll dive into several "typical" Flemish/Belgian themes, such as design, comics, European institutions, cycling and, of course, chocolate and beer. We’ll explore cutting-edge museums and the European parliament, visit various Belgian cities, get guided by experts and reflect on the culture here through discussions, presentations and tourism and journalism related assignments. Please note that this course will cost you between 130 and 150 euro for travel and tours only. All excursions are required.
