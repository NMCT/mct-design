### End goal

In deep learning and advanced AI you learn how we can train different AI models. In this module, the AI services & Mlops module, we want to take these AI models into production. Developers use these trained models in their applications. In addition, AI engineers want to constantly improve and retrain their models.

In this module we will elaborate on deploying Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in a Cloud environment via a CI / CD pipeline. End users call on Microservices or AI services via a frontend environment. The various applications end up in queues that are processed by a scalable back-end environment powered by powerful GPUs. This environment is based on Docker containers and is managed by a Kubernetes platform. The established CI / CD pipeline will be scripted via Python, Powershell or other CLI tools.

The CI / CD pipeline is the backbone of the project. The intention is that this pipeline will be managed by Data Scientists, AI Engineers, front and back end developers and the DevOps team. The entire environment will work on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. This technically driven module is a deep dive on technology such as Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Server Less computing platforms. At the end of the module you will be able to set up and manage a complete data pipeline.

### Prerequisites

You need prior knowledge of Docker. Deep learning has to be followed in the same semester as MLOps (or prior knowledge needs to be documented)
