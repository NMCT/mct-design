### End Goal

This practical course studies the implementation of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning systems. Self-learning systems find patterns and an optimal strategy trough **trial and error**. That delivers the **maximum reward**. This (Deep) Reinforcement Learning process is often used in self-driving cars, computer games, industrial process optimisation and personalised recommendations. Furthermore we will delve deeper into some of the most popular optimisation and simulation techniques that will enhance the performance of your learning algorithms.
