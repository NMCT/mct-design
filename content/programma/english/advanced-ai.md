### End Goal

The machine learning and deep learning modules already provided you with a solid foundation for the concepts of the modern AI and how to implement it in a practical way. In this specializing module Advanced AI, we build on these foundations and focus on specific application domains such as advanced computer vision, advanced NLP (natural language processing), generative neural networks, belief networks and multiple-input multiple-output systems.

In addition to further deepening of data-driven machine learning systems, we also study and implement reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning systems in this course. Instead of learning from data, these self-learning systems use trial & error to look for an optimal strategy that will give them a maximum reward. These (deep) reinforcement learning strategies mainly find applications in self-learning robots, optimization of industrial processes, computer games, self-driving cars and personalized recommendations. In addition, we go deeper into a number of popular optimization and simulation techniques that can significantly improve the performance of your used learning algorithm.

This module is also hand-on with the focus on being able to implement and integrate the AI systems seen in practice. In that respect, it is intended that you come into contact with various state-of-the-art AI frameworks for the development of both deep neural networks and for the design and simulation of (deep) reinforcement learning systems.
