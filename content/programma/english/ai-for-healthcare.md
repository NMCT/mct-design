Choice between Deep Learning or AI for Healthcare

You can take up AI for healthcare if you want to study Deep Learning in this specific context. 

### End Goal
In this course you will learn how to apply the frequently utilized deep learning algorithms in the context of (bio-)medical) data. How to handle patient data, DNA data and medical images such as x-rays are just a few of the topics that will be covered during this course. Another important aspect that will be explored is interpretable AI, as it is often important in the healthcare sector to know why an algorithm takes a certain decision.  

### Themes
- Introduction to deep learning and neural networks.  
- Analysing medical images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), e.g. lung segmentation from x-ray images, and interpretable AI. 
- Auto-encoders: can reconstruct lost or damaged data but it can also be used to detect anomalies.  
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Used for, for example, image generation, predicting which medicine will work with certain symptoms, etc. 
- The central dogma of molecular biology and interpreting DNA data with Long Short-term memory networks.  
- Using reinforcement learning to determine which treatment course is the best option for a patient.
