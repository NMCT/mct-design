      <description>The Collective is a module that requires international and / or interdisciplinary teamwork: you get the chance to work together with Energy Management or Industrial Product Design students.
You start in a motivated team of young entrepreneurs with a great idea for a product or a service and at the end you deliver a prototype or business case and a business plan.
You have already a ton of project work experience but it is a whole different ball game if you team up with people with another background.</description>
